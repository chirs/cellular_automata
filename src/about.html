<h2>What is this?</h2>

<p>So you're asking the eternal question: What the heck is a generic cellular automata simulator?</p>

<p>What are the limitations of this simulator?<p>
<ol>
  <li>Cells are squares, which means that each cell has four neighbors. If cells were hexagonal, each cell would have 6 neighbors. Adjacencies matter for cellular automata</li>
  <li>Turns take place sequentially. That means that every cell changes at the same time. This is how pretty much all cellular automata function, but there are exceptions.</li>
  <li>That's it I think.</li>
</ol>

<p>Great question! Here's the simplest explanation I can figure out.</p>


<p>A cellular automaton consists of a space and a rule.</p>

<p>A cellular automaton starts with a grid, usually (but not always) a two-dimensional grid.

<p>Grid image</p>

<p>Second comes a rule. Every turn, the each cell on the grid gets a new state based on this rule.</p>

<p>

<p>The best known rule comes from John Conway. That rule is: any "live" cell lives if it has two or three live neighbors. Any dead cell that has three neighbors comes alive. Any other situation results in a dead cell.</p>

<p>But wait, what does it mean to be "alive" or "dead"? It doesn't mean a lot, that is just an easy way of thinking about it. And in fact, it's possible to have more than two states.</p>

<p>How many different rules are there? Honestly, there's as many as you can imagine. But if you apply certain restrictions, you can count them.</p>

</p>A cellular automata can be defined by: 


<p>One-dimensional automata</p>

<p>It's easier to start by thinking about one-dimensional automata. A one dimensional automata just looks like a strip with alternating squares.</p>

<p>

<p>Two-dimensional automata</p>
