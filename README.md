A cellular automata simulator.

Currently contains two machines:

A simple Langton's ant simulator that can an arbitrary number of states.
A generic cellular automata simulator that can simulate von Neumann's elementary automata, 2-d automata including Conway's Game of Life, and n-dimensional automata.
